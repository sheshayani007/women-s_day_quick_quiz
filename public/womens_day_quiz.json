          "Marie Van Brittan Brown – Home Security Systems (1966, USA)\n\nLiving in a high-crime neighborhood, Marie Van Brittan Brown often felt unsafe at home. But instead of waiting for better protection, she invented it—the first home security system, complete with cameras, two-way microphones, and a remote-controlled lock. Wiring together a complex setup at home was no small feat, especially with limited technology and resources. Some doubted whether her idea would take off, but her system laid the groundwork for modern surveillance. Today, her innovation protects homes, businesses, and millions of lives around the world."

Her groundbreaking Noether’s Theorem proved that every symmetry in nature corresponds to a conservation law—for example, the fact that energy never disappears comes from the symmetry of time. Despite being more brilliant than many of her male peers, she wasn’t allowed to hold a paid university position for years. Today, her work is fundamental in everything from quantum mechanics to relativity, shaping the very way we understand the universe."
